The residential application segment holds the largest share, driven by the increasing popularity of compact, time-saving, and user-friendly kitchen gadgets. Residential consumers are opting for smart mini rice cookers to simplify cooking, as these devices can be programmed for various rice cooking needs and can even adjust cooking times for different types of grains. Additionally, the growing trend of smart homes and the increased reliance on IoT-connected devices further fuels the demand for these smart appliances in households.

Consumers in the U.S. are increasingly shopping for kitchen appliances online due to the convenience, wide selection, and competitive pricing offered by digital marketplaces. Major online retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart, have dedicated sections for smart kitchen appliances, and these platforms provide consumers with detailed product descriptions, user reviews, and easy comparison tools. Additionally, the rise of digital advertising and influencer marketing has contributed to the growth of online sales, as brands target consumers seeking innovative, smart home devices.
